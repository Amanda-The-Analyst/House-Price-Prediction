# House-Price-Prediction
In this project, I develop a Python program that predicts the price of houses in Boston using a machine learning algorithm called Linear Regression. Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables).

Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest for both buyers and sellers. Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won’t begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition’s data-set proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

About the Dataset

Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest for both buyers and sellers. In this project, house prices will be predicted given explanatory variables that cover many aspects of residential houses. The goal of this project is to create a regression model that is able to accurately estimate the price of the house given the features.
